# draw

This is an art toy for drawing turtle graphics.

The point of this tool is for me to have a simple way to experiment with design
ideas or make little vector diagrams. This is not an "Open Source project", and
I am not "seeking contributions". If you happen to stumble across this code and
find it interesting or useful as-is, great. If not... well, it's a big world
out there. Plenty of other software is waiting to be written or explored.

The hosted version of this code is at https://samblenny.github.io/draw/
